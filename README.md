# EarthWise: AI-Powered Learning for SDGs

EarthWise is a sophisticated full-stack web application designed to educate users about the United Nations' 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) through AI-driven, interactive learning experiences. With multilingual support, text translation, and advanced Text-to-Speech (TTS) services, the platform ensures accessibility and inclusivity for a global audience of over 1,000 users.

At the heart of EarthWise lies its AI Tutor, an intelligent and engaging virtual assistant powered by cutting-edge AI technologies. This tutor delivers interactive lessons using real-time TTS and Lip Sync technology to simulate life-like interactions, making the learning journey captivating and highly impactful.

## Features

**1. AI-Powered Tutor**

The platform leverages OpenAI's GPT-3 to deliver personalized, interactive lessons on the 17 SDGs, responding intelligently to user queries and simulating dynamic interactions within an AR/VR environment.

It integrates the ElevenLabs API for natural, human-like Text-to-Speech output, enhancing auditory engagement and creating a more immersive experience.

Rhubarb Lip Sync technology is used to synchronize lip movements with spoken words, ensuring a lifelike and visually interactive experience with the virtual tutor.

*Unreal Engine* is incorporated to power the AR/VR model, enabling realistic, immersive simulations that bring the AI tutor to life in a fully interactive 3D environment.

**2. Text Translation**

Uses the Google Translate API to translate content into multiple languages in real time, ensuring accessibility to a global user base.

Supports localization to cater to cultural and linguistic preferences, expanding the platform's reach and inclusivity.

**3. Text-to-Speech (TTS)**

Delivers audio narration of lessons using advanced Text-to-Speech capabilities from Web Speech API and ElevenLabs API.

TTS ensures users with visual impairments or learning differences can fully participate in lessons, breaking accessibility barriers.

**4. Lip Sync Technology**

Powered by Rhubarb Lip Sync and FFmpeg, ensuring seamless synchronization of the virtual tutor's lip movements with audio output.

The result is a realistic, life-like avatar interaction that enhances the learning experience, particularly for visual learners.

**5. Multilingual Support**

Supports a diverse audience by providing lessons in multiple languages, ensuring inclusivity and equitable learning opportunities for all.

Can cater to more than 1,000 active users globally, offering a robust infrastructure for real-time translation and lesson delivery.
